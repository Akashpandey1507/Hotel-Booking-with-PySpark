# The Question are;

Certainly! Here are some questions for the analysis of the provided hotel dataset:

1. What is the overall cancellation rate for the resort hotel and how does it compare to the city hotel?
2. What is the average lead time for bookings in both resort and city hotels? Are there any trends over time?
3. Which month had the highest number of bookings in the dataset, and which had the highest cancellations?
4. What is the most common type of meal booked by guests in both hotel types?
5. Is there a correlation between the number of booking changes and the likelihood of cancellation?
6. What is the distribution of customer types (e.g., Transient, Contract) in the dataset, and do different customer types have different cancellation rates?
7. Are there any patterns in the number of special requests made by guests who stay in the city hotel compared to the resort hotel?
8. What is the average daily rate (ADR) for each hotel type, and how does it vary by room type?
9. Is there a relationship between the average daily rate (ADR) and the number of required car parking spaces in the dataset?
10. Can you identify any correlations between economic indicators (e.g., GDP, unemployment rate) and the number of bookings or cancellations in the dataset?
